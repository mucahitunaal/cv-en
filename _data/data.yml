    - role: R&D / Intern
      time: 06.2018 - 09.2018
      company: Robsen Robotics,GOSB Teknopark/Kocaeli
      details: |
        I completed my 30 day internship in this company, which is in the regulation of our school. Here I learned ROS (Robot Operating System) and a good level of Python language. Although my compulsory internship is 30 days, I voluntarily interned for 90 days. During the internship, I designed an autonomous vehicle based on Raspberry Pi and ROS, which determines the path only according to the data received from the cameras. Thanks to this project, I learned advanced image processing, Raspberry Pi and Linux usage.

        According to the regulations of our school, we have 7 semesters of compulsory education and 1 semester of compulsory long-term internship. I completed this long-term internship in the R&D department of Samm Teknoloji company. In this company, we prepared a project that reads data from fiber optic cables, protects border security and thus supports the defense industry, for IDEF, which is carried out together with TUBITAK Bilgem.

      details: |
        I worked as an Electronic Software Engineer in the Embedded Software and Systems Design department of Arge Bilişim. I took part in the team that designed the circuits of the RF data collection terminals that provide wireless communication via antenna and LoRa protocol. On the hardware side, we designed and produced our own PCB boards by drawing power, USBHub, RS232-UART, TFT touch screen with DPI-I2C interface and low-high pass PWM audio circuits with Proteus program. In software, I designed interfaces enriched with graphics through Qt Framework and developed algorithms with OOP logic using C++ language. I left my job in order to complete my military service.

      - title: LoRa and WIFI Based Touch TFT RF Data Collection Terminal @rge Hypatia 
        link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EomXU4ctLNs"
        tagline: "@rge HYPATIA is an industrial and touch IOT data collection terminal that we developed as hardware and software while working at Arge Bilişim company in order to increase efficiency and quality in factories. It has the ability to play video, image and audio files. Audio output is provided by headphones and speakers. It collects RFID,barcode and qrcode data in real time. It can be connected to the Wi-Fi network either wired or wirelessly. It communicates using RS232 and USB protocols. It also has a very powerful RF communication system on it and can communicate wirelessly at a distance of up to 5 KM thanks to the system. Therefore, it continues to collect real-time data even if the Wi-Fi communication is lost."
